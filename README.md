# Library-Management-System-GUI
This is a GUI-based desktop application that I developed in Python and I integrated SQLite 3 database with it to store the data. In this application, we can enter the record of new books and retrieve the details of books available in the library. We can issue the books to the students and maintain their records and can also check how many books are issued and stock available in the library. In this project, we can also maintain the late fine of students who returns the issued books after the due date.
